title: Thoughts about introductions strategies for fundraising
---

Raising funds for you startup is a tough job, specially on the beginning of your journey. On this post I would like to
focus on the _approach_ part of the process, and to investigate one of the fatal mistakes I made- giving up on introductions.

We all know how efficient a good intro can be, and how can we benefit from that. And actually that's the exact reason I,
and almost every businessman work so hard to create a large network of connections.

At the past year I managed to know, connect and to create new friendships with a lot of great entrepreneurs, businessmen and investors.
But when I started my round I found that it's harder than I thought to manage them to get intros, specially because lacking
of clear strategy.

## Lacking of strategy symptoms

1. **You can't ask too many favours** - you can only ask for one or two favours in a while, more than that people will start
to ignore you.
2. **Your success too depends on luck**
3. **You don't really know who can help you**
4. **You losing patient, and start cold mailing** - TL;DR: cold mails are bad unless you are a well-known personality.

## Planing your strategy
Planing your strategy can helps you to gather more control over your process, and to create meaningful introductions.

When I started to write this blog post, I first mapped my connections:
![Connections map]({{ site.github.url }}/images/connections-map.png)

I notice that I can split my contacts into the following groups:

1. **Not relevant(0)** - friends that cannot help me with my goal, or contacts that I don't really know
2. **Friends(1)** - friends that will help me, but they not close friends- so I need to be very specific with them,
and to minimize their favor.
3. **Good friends(2)** - well-connected friends that will connect me to their relevant contacts without hesitate,
some of them might even spend some time to plan it with me.
4. **Need intro(N)** - people I determinate that I need an intro with them, and I don't know them; Can be either on my contacts or not.

Generally, there are two strategies I determinate can help me here: finding all the intros that _contact can made_, or
finding all the _contacts that relevant for the investor_.

### Intros by contacts
Just contact your good-friends(2), and ask them who can they connect you with.
### Finding intros to investor
List all the potential investors that may interest in your opportunity,  weather you know them or not, then narrow down the people
that can introduce you to them(friends levels 2,1).
Then, only after you list all the possible connections you'll need from specific contact- approach him.

&lowast; Don't waste your time on getting intros to people who'll probably won't invest in your company (not in your field, etc.). <br />
&lowast; You'll probably can ask for only one favour from friend in level 1, so ask it once for all the intros, and avoid splitting
   your requests.

## How to build the plan

### The hard way - manually exporting your contacts 
You can export your facebook/linkedin contacts list to excel, then start to "filtering" them into the friendship
level, and realize the map of the connections..

### The easy way -  My tool: [Actionable connections](http://actionable-connections.chiefangel.com)
After I started to write this post, I realize that its quite difficult and consuming to apply both of the strategies and
organizing your contacts into actionable plan. So I've built  simple tool that helps you to organize your LinkedIn contacts into an
actionable strategy.

After you logged in with your LinkedIn account, the tool helping you to "flag" the contact by his friendship-level.
Then, the tool creating a report for you that shows you how to act in order to achieve your goal, and get the relevant introduction.

<br />
&lowast; I published the **"Actionable connections"** tool as [open-source](), so feel free to fork it or using it on add integrations. <br />
&lowast; This tool is not saving any data on any server, and all the processing is actually made on the client-side, so your privacy is safe.

## Keep track on your process
I highly recommend you to keep track on your progress by documenting **EVERY SINGLE INTERACTION**,  and describe the whole
fundraising process as pipeline.<br />
You can manage the pipeline by using CRM such as [pipedrive](http://bit.ly/1dB0m4z).
