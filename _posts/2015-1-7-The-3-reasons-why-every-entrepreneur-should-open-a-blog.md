title: The 3 reasons why every entrepreneur should open a blog
---
Hey guys,<br />
This is my first blog post, woohoo~! so I'll do my best, by trying keep it maintained.

Today I'll explain you **why I opened this blog**, and why every young entrepreneur do the same.

## Why entrepreneurs needs a blog?

#### 1. No body knows you
I known for a long time that blog is something that I _**need** to do_. But, it actually really seeped into my mind after my friends, @LiorKesos and @SagiShrieber, convinced me to do so; Sagi told to me something really powerful:

> " You might be very talented, and people who worked with you know that as well. But its the rest of the world who has no clue who you are and what you're worth. "
> <cite>Sagi Shrieber</cite>

Letting people know you is generally good thing for business-man. for instance-it cal let investors the opportunity to know you better, think about it like a "cheat" to gain an advantage from all the other entrepreneurs that nobody knows.

#### 2. Build your brand
As entrepreneur, your probably know that **you are your startup**.
Branding yourself as "a person who know what he's talking about" eill brand your business as well; A thing that could help you in every almost aspects:

1. **Fundraising** - "well known" entrepreneur is sexier than the others! Everybody want to bet on the next raising star.
1. **Hiring** - your blog can convince good candidates that impressed by you to apply and join your company. Everybody want to learn from the bests; you just need to convince them(and almost everybody) that you're the best.
1. *Marketing* - as I said before: **your startup=you**, people who'll read your blog will probably want to try your brand new product.
1. *Share your thoughts* - dah?? :P

#### 3. Updates about your progress

Blog is a great tool to help to create a group of followers/fans of yours. Followers could be other entrepreneurs, investors, users, developers, and even your ~~rich~~ uncle.

Updating your followers with your progress could be a good thing: telling them about what you learned from your progress could and help you to gain their trust and to **connect** with you, your product, and your company by making them _feel_ like part of your journey.
