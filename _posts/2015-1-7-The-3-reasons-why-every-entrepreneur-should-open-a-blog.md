title: The 3 reasons why every entrepreneur should open a blog
---

Hey guys,<br />
This is my first blog post! woohoo~! so I'll try to do my best, and keep this blog maintained.

Today I'll try to explain you **why I opened this blog** and why you should do the same.

## Why entrepreneurs needs a blog?

#### 1. No body knows you
I known for a long time that blog is something that I _**need** to do_. But, it actually really seeped into my
mind after my friends @LiorKesos and @SagiShrieber told me that. Sagi just said to me something really powerful:

> " You can be really talented, and people that knows you probably know that...<br />
> The thing is- you don't work wish most of them. "
> <cite>Sagi Shrieber</cite>

He's right. Also blog can help you to fundraise, and to let the investors to know you better. Think about it like a "cheat"
to get an advantage from all the other entrepreneurs that nobody knows.

#### 2. Build your brand
As entrepreneur, your probably know that **your startup = you**.
Branding yourself as "a person who know what he's talking about" could help you in every almost aspects:

1. **Fundraising** - "well known" entrepreneur is just sexier than other! everybody want to invest on the next raising star.
1. **Hiring** - your blog can convince candidates that impressed by your blog to apply. Everybody want to learn from the
bests; you just need to convince them(and almost everybody) that you're the best.
1. *Marketing* - as I said before: **your startup=you**, people who'll read your blog will probably want to try your
brand new product.
1. *Share your thoughts* - dah?? :P

#### 3. Updates about your progress

Blog will helps you to create a group of followers. Followers could be other entrepreneurs, investors, users, developers,
and even your ~~rich~~ uncle.

Updating your followers with your progress is actually a good thing: it's telling them you learn from your progress,
and helps them to **connect** with you and your project.
