title: Why does Symfony2 changed my life? and how does it saved me from hell.

This is really nice post which written with MARKDOWN over github pages.

Example for my highlighter

```ruby
puts 'I am ruby'
```
```php
<?php
echo "cool";
```
```js
console.log('aaa');
```

```php
<?php
echo "cool";
```

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
