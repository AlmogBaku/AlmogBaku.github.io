title: Disciplinary lean strategy
---
As you may know, the most famous use-case for lean methodology apply for the _product_ lifecycle-
You build a *product*, measure the *product* usage, learn from the *product* data, and build again.

Although, I believe this methodology can be applied for other disciplines of the company, and not only for product development,
you just need to use the "Build > Measure > Learn" loop for each discipline of the company.
In this way, I believe you can align the whole company towards **the most important goals** of the initiative, and to establish/disapprove your
assumptions much faster (and wast less time and money).

## Company lean strategy
One of the most important things you *MUST* do, is to build a Company-Level strategy. In my opinion- it'll be wise to plan a
lean strategy for your whole company, and drip it from [top to down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design)
to all the other departments in the company that will be involved in this initiative(or experiment in the lean word).

The idea is to focus the team on the goals, in order to achieve the most accurate solution, without wasting time in the
on useless activities for this stage(for example: building too complicated product as an MVP) which means: building the MVP
of the whole initiative(including every related aspect, from hr, toward r&d and even BizDev)

### Build
You need to ask yourself what are the hypothesis you trying to answer in the company level-

1. What is the vision?
1. Who are you trying to help?
1. Which kind of products you can build in order to solve them?
1. What are the business goals?

### Measure
Plan your KPIs, be on track and have a clear measurements in order to understand what kind of achievements will serve you
in order to accomplish the next company milestone(fundraising, growth, key hiring, etc).

### Dripping down
The next step is to build a sub-strategy for each department, this strategy should answer the top-level business goals which
we defined above. It's really important to track the company goals driven when building a startup company. In this
way you can keep your organization very focused on the target and allow your team to achieve your goals in much more efficient and fast way.

I'll go briefly over the different disciplines of the company in order to demonstrate:

Let's say our high-level vision is to **help travelers plan a better trip for their vocation**, therefore our business objectives for the
next milestone will be:

1. Help the traveler predict his expenses
1. Learn about the market from first-hand
1. Acquire 100 early adopters that willing to use this product
1. Acquire at least 1 paying costumer, in order to examine the business model

## Product strategy
We need to detail our high-level business objectives in order to understand what is the most necessary goals that we need
in order to deliver our MVP:

1. Plan a demo application: "Calculator for traveling"
1. Design the the UI

### Measure(KPIs)
1. 30% of the users open the app more than once
1. At least 3 good(more than 3 stars) reviews in the application store(not from friends!)

## Marketing strategy
1. Design a landing page
1. Design a social marketing plan

### Measure(KPIs)
1. At least 30% conversion rate to the website
1. At least 30% conversion rate for download
1. 100 subscribers to the mailing list
1. 400 Facebook likes

## BizDev / Sales
1. Examine different business models
1. Experiment one business model
1. Feeding the system with relevant leads
1. Closing at least 1 deal

### Measure(KPIs)
1. At least 20 leads
1. Positive feedback from potential costumers
1. Closed 1 deal

## R&D strategy
1. Build a *prototype* application
1. Build a landing page
1. Measure the user retention
1. Hiring 1 developer

### Measure(KPIs)
1. Delivering time
1. Reasonable burning chart
1. Delivering all the goals within 1 month

## Company Learn
After the cycle of the milestone completed, we need to summarize all the high-level knowledge from the various departments,
and decide about the next big goal.
This is probably the most crucial stage- now you need to align all the departments and understand whether this initiative
was successful, whether you need to pivot, or even kill the whole initiative.
