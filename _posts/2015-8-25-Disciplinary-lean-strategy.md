title: Disciplinary lean strategy
---
As you may know, the most famous use-case for lean methodology apply for the _product_ lifecycle-
You build a *product*, measure the *product* usage, learn from the *product* data, and build again.

Although, I believe this methodology can be applied for other disciplines of the company, and not only for product
development, you just need to use the "Build > Measure > Learn" loop for each discipline of the company.
In this way, I believe you can align the whole company towards **the most important goals** of the initiative, and to
establish/disapprove your assumptions much faster (and wast less time and money).

## Company lean strategy
One of the most important things you *MUST* do, is to build a Company-Level strategy. In my opinion- on early stages the
wise approach is to plan a very **focused** strategy for your whole company, and drip it from
[top to down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) to all the other departments of the company.

The idea is to focus the team on the goals, in order to achieve the make the most of the time, without wasting any time
by useless activities for this stage.

### Company-Level: Idea
You need to ask yourself what are the next business goals? (validation, hiring, market share growth, revenues, marketing,
profitability, efficiency etc.)

### Company-Level: Build - Dripping down
The next step is to build a sub-strategy for each department, this strategy should answer the top-level business goals
which we defined above. It's really important to follow the company goals when you build the department goals, in this
way you can keep your organization very focused on the target, and allow your team to achieve your goals in much faster
and efficient way.

I'll go briefly over the different disciplines of the company in order to demonstrate:

#### Product strategy
We need to understand our MUST-HAVE objectives in order to fulfill the business goals:

1. What is the product/experiment?
1. Which features are REQUIRED in order to accomplish the mission?

#### BizDev / Sales
First we need to understand what are the minimum achievements that REQUIRED in order to face the business goals, and then
to understand which steps we MUST do in order to accomplish that.

This is the MOST painful phase for me as a tech entrepreneur(who responsible for the tech stuff). You can always
optimize/improve the product, and of course better products sales better.. **BUT** that's doesn't mean you need to do it
now!

As a CTO, almost ALWAYS the BizDev guys approaching me and asking me X because that will improve his chances to close the
deal. Because of my painful experience with my previous company, I used to argue with them and convince them with the
obvious(at least for me) arguments("we have to stop adding new features..", "it's not necessary for the product..", "it's
not lean..", "why do we need that?"), but every single time I loosed at the battle- because the BizDev came with the
unbeatable argument "the most important thing is to close the deal, this thing can close the deal", and let's face it-
I couldn't beat that. I wasn't presence on those sales meetings, they was; therefor they know better than me what will
close the deal. However, the reality is a bit different. **MOST of the time the users/clients doesn't even know what
they want.**

Recently, I figured that maybe I'm just asking the wrong question. We can have a good or bad opinion about ideas, but ideas
stay ideas- and we can't have a knockout fact whether they will work or not. So- instead of asking if it's good or bad
maybe we need to ask **"What is necessary in order to close the deal?", "What is prevent the client from closing the
deal?", "What are the roots of our problem?"** or even maybe **"What are our problems?"**.

After figuring what stopping us from going further we can understand what is *truly* required in order to continue the
process.


## Company-Level: Measure
Plan your KPIs, be on track and have a clear measurements in order to understand what kind of achievements will serve you
in order to accomplish the next company milestone(fundraising, growth, key hiring, etc).

## Company-Level: Learning
After the cycle of the milestone completed, we need to summarize all the high-level knowledge from the various departments,
and decide about the next big goal. This is probably the most crucial stage- now you need to align all the departments
and understand whether this initiative was successful, whether you need to pivot, or even kill the whole initiative.

On this stage, every department should try and figure whether they met their assumptions and what does it means.
E.g. if the BizDev dept. haven't established their assumptions, but the product dept. established there is a clear need
for their product, the company should consider "pivoting" the business model.
