title: Android is going to Go! - Android and Golang
---

I recently talked in Droidcon about building using Go with Android
We talked about what is Go? And why it's so awesome? And how can we use it with Android?
On this session we've learnt a little bit about Go, and how can we use it with Android- about the use cases, and the secret
tricks to use it with mobile applications.

Here are the slides of my lecture:
