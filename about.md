Hey there!
My name is Almog Baku; I am an entrepreneur, leader, and developer with 9 years of experience. Expert in
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and in getting things done.

On this blog I'll write about entrepreneurship and development.

### My story

As long as I remember myself, I always loved to found initiatives. Even back in 2004, as a young boy, I first enjoyed to
dive into a bunch of code, and hack it to meet my needs for my projects.

Very fast I found myself doing advanced programing, and [contributing to the open-source community](http://github.com/AlmogBaku),
and of course- started to making money by using my skills.

### Funny facts about me

 (Total 10K users).
