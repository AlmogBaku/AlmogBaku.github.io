Hey there!
My name is Almog Baku; I am an entrepreneur, leader, and developer with more than 12 years of experience. Expert in
[Go](https://www.golang.org) and in getting things done.

On this blog I'll write about entrepreneurship and development.

### My story

As long as I remember myself, I always loved to found initiatives. Even back in 2004, as a young boy, I first enjoyed to
dive into a bunch of code, and hack it to meet my needs for my projects.

Very fast I found myself doing advanced programing, and [contributing to the open-source community](http://github.com/AlmogBaku),
and of course- started to making money by using my skills.

### Funny facts about me and my youth
 - At age 12 I founded community forums website, and was able to convince 3 bigger communities to merge into my platform
 (Total ~50K users).
 - At age 13 I was hired for the first time as a freelancer developer (for a local ISP company).
 - At age 15 I founded my first startup(although at the time I didn't called it a startup) Eyooi, which offered a customer service through ICQ. The service actually allowed users to message the brand's bot, and to chat with him- while in the background the client customer service suggested a queue management, and multi-agent features. It's kinda funny that startup companies do the same thing today with Facebook messanger (which have a way more easier protocol than [ICQ protocol](http://iserverd.khstu.ru/oscar/)).
 - At age 16 I founded [my first non-profit "startup"](http://www.zofim.org.il/magazin_item.asp?item_id=114306200464&troop_id=&past=archive),
 and recruited 6 other volunteers in order to enhance the education skills of the Israeli Scouts movement guides.
 - At 17 I was hired as a developer at [mantis](http://www.mantis.co.il).
 - Served as combat soldier at [Golani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golani_Brigade) ([IDF](http://www.idf.il/English/)).
 - At age 19 I lectured for the first time in a [professional developers conference](http://www.slideshare.net/AlmogBaku/drupal-javascript-14718275).
 - At age 20 I founded my first hi-tech startup, SocialBelong - As the comapny's CEO I was able to lead my team to acquired 18 paying costumers, and managed 6 employees.

### Highlights

 - Co-Founder and CTO of [Rimoto](http://www.rimoto.net)
 - Co-Founder and CEO of SocialBelong (formerly GoDisco)
 - Creator of some popular [open-source projects](http://github.com/AlmogBaku)
 - Maintainer in popular open-source projects such as [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io)
 - Occasionally lecturing on technology(mainly Go, but used to talk also about Android, PHP, Symfony, Drupal) and entreprenurship
