Hey there!
My name is Almog Baku; I am an entrepreneur, leader, and developer with 9 years of experience. Expert in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) and in getting things done.

On this blog I'll write about entrepreneurship and development.

### Story of my life

As long as I remember myself, I always loved to found initiatives. Even back in 2004, as a young boy, I first enjoyed to dive into a bunch of code, and hack it to meet my needs for my projects.
Very fast I found myself start to learn advanced PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and contributing to the open-source community, and of course- starting to makes money from my skills.
